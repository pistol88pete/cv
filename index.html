  <p>Currently looking into becoming a sort of Web Developer but I know I still have tons to learn.
    In relation to work/jobs, this passion I have for it is unlike anything I've ever felt before.
    Its amazing learning all these new things and the endless knowledge out there just waiting for me.
    With the support of my family, I look forward to all the possibilities this holds for me. </p>
